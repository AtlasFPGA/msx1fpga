Registers:

(R )	00 => Machine ID number
(R )	01 => Machine name (text), read to receive a null character.
(R )	02 => Version (Nibble most significant = Major, Nibble less significant = Minor)
( W)	0A =>
			bit 0 = Soft reset
( W)	0D => Lower address of Keymap
( W)	0E => High address of Keymap (bits 1-0)
( W)	0F => Write a byte to keymap (address auto-increment)
(RW)	10 =>
			bit 1 = Scandoubler-VGA (1 = enabled)
			bit 0 = Nextor SD interface enable (slot 3.2) (1 = enabled)
(RW)	11 =>
			bits 1-0 = Slot 1: SCC mapper type (X0 = SCC-I, 01 = ASCII 8, 11 = ASCII 16)
(RW)	12 =>
			bit 0 = Turbo
